//
//Part 1: Implement a superclass BankAccount that has the following fields and methods.

//        Fields:

//string firstName
//string lastName
//int accountID
//double balance

//Methods:

//constructor():  initialize balance to zero

//deposit() - will accept a single value double parameter; the parameter value is added to the existing balance

//withdrawal() - accepts a single value double dollar amount; the parameter value is subtracted from the existing balance

//Setters and getters for firstName, lastName, and accountID
//getBalance() getter to return the balance
//accountSummary() - prints all account information
//Part 2: Implement a CheckingAccount class that inherits from the BankAccount class, that:
//Has an interest rate attribute
//Allows overdraft withdrawals and charges a $30 fee
//Methods:
//processWithdrawal() - will display a negative balance that includes a $30 overdraft fee and denotes that a fee has been accessed
//displayAccount() - should display all superclass attributes and provides an additional interest rate
//Ensure that your program has the two required classes and a test class.
//Place each Java class into a separate Java source file.
//Students must use appropriate version control for all programmatic assignments created. GIT repositories should be established and screen captures of repositories submitted with each assignment.
//Submit screenshots of your program's execution and output. Include all appropriate source code in a zip file.
